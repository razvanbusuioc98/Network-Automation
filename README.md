🐍 Network Automation with Python & Netmiko 🐍

This repository documents my journey into **Network Automation**, containing scripts and tools developed to transition from manual CLI configuration to automated workflows. 

The projects are based on real-world scenarios simulated in **GNS3/GNS3 VM**, focusing on scalability, error handling, and efficiency using the **Netmiko** library.
